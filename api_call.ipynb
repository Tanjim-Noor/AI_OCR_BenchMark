    "## Extraction Guidelines:\n",
    "- **Supplier**: Look for business name, vendor name, or \"Bill To\" information\n",
    "- **Payment Account**: Extract account numbers, card details, or payment method info\n",
    "- **Payment Date**: Find transaction date, invoice date, or payment date\n",
    "- **Payment Method**: Identify if paid by cash, card, check, bank transfer, etc.\n",
    "- **Reference Number**: Look for invoice #, receipt #, transaction ID, or reference number\n",
    "- **Tags**: Generate relevant tags based on the business type or expense category\n",
    "- **Item Details**: Extract ALL line items from the document - create a separate object for each item/product/service listed\n",
    "- **Categories**: Classify expenses (office supplies, travel, meals, equipment, etc.)\n",
    "- **Calculations**: Verify that item totals sum to subtotal, and final calculations are accurate\n",
    "- **Language Handling**: If you encounter Bangla/Bengali text, transliterate it into English letters (e.g., \"টাকা\" becomes \"taka\", \"নাম\" becomes \"naam\"). Do not translate the meaning, just write how the Bangla words sound in English.\n",
    "- **Tax/VAT Recognition**: Look for any tax-related terms including \"Tax\", \"VAT\", \"Sales Tax\", \"Service Tax\", \"GST\", or similar terms in both English and Bangla. Treat all of these as sales tax in the JSON structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Rules:\n",
    "- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Ensure sum of all item totals equals subtotal\n",
    "- **Date Formats**: Only use dates that are clearly visible; don't assume date formats\n",
    "- **Number Precision**: Use exact numbers from the document, don't round unless specified\n",
    "- **Text Clarity**: If you cannot read text clearly due to image quality, use null\n",
    "- **Cross-Reference**: Verify supplier name appears consistently throughout the document\n",
    "- **Currency Consistency**: Ensure all amounts use the same currency basis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes:\n",
    "- Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanations\n",
    "- If information is missing, use null for strings and 0 for numbers\n",
    "- Ensure all numbers are numeric values, not strings\n",
    "- **Extract every single line item** - the item_details array should contain one object for each product/service listed in the document\n",
    "- Double-check mathematical accuracy of totals and ensure all item totals sum to the subtotal\n",
    "- VAT and tax should be considered same.\n",
    "- If no tax/VAT or discount is present, set the respective amounts to 0\n",
    "- Do not interpolate or guess missing information** - use null for unclear data\n",
    "- Double-check all calculations manually** before submitting the JSON\n",
    "- If image quality is poor and text is unreadable, explicitly use null values**\n",
    "- Verify that reference numbers and dates match standard formats for the region**\n",
    "- Cross-validate totals: item_totals → subtotal → (±tax/discount) → final_total**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Check:\n",
    "Before responding, verify:\n",
    "1. All visible numbers are accurately transcribed\n",
    "2. Mathematical relationships are correct\n",
    "3. No information has been assumed or fabricated\n",
    "4. Bangla text is transliterated, not translated\n",
    "5. All required fields contain appropriate data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Now please analyze the provided image and extract the data according to this schema.\n",
    "        \"\"\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "                \"cash_expense_extraction_V4\": \"\"\"\n",
    "You are an expert document processing assistant. Extract structured data from invoice/receipt images and return as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "CORE RULES:\n",
    "- Extract only visible information - never guess missing data\n",
    "- Use null for unclear/obscured text\n",
    "- DO NOT hallucinate or invent information not present in the image\n",
    "- If you cannot see text clearly, use null rather than guessing\n",
    "- Convert Bangla numerals to English (১২৩ → 123)\n",
    "- Transliterate Bangla text to English phonetics (টাকা → taka)\n",
    "- Verify calculations match document totals\n",
    "- Return ONLY the JSON object\n",
